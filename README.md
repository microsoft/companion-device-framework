# Windows Hello Unlock using Companion Devices

Welcome to the Companion Device Framework Github Repostiory. 

## Introduction

This repo hosts Windows UWP sample code to illustrate the use of Companion Device Framework (CDF), a new feature in Windows 10, enabling developers to build UWP apps to unlock Windows 10 PCs. A companion device is a device that can act in conjunction with your Windows 10 desktop to enhance the user authentication experience. Using the Companion Device Framework, a companion device can provide a rich experience for Microsoft Passport even when Windows Hello is not available (e.g., if the Windows 10 desktop lacks a camera for face authentication or fingerprint reader device, for example).

## Requirements

- Windows 10 Anniversary Update Enterprise/Professional edition (Build 10.0.14393 or later)
- Visual Studio 2015
- [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)

## Requesting capabilities for Store Submissions of your CDF UWP App

You are free to use the code sample to create your own CDF UWP app to unlock Windows PCs.  To submit your app to the Store, you would need permissions to use the secondaryAuthenticationFactor restricted capability.    For the same, please mail Companion Device Framework Onboarding <CDFOnboard@microsoft.com>.
